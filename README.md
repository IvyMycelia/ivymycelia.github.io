# My Portfolio Website

Hey there! I'm Ivy Mycelia, and this is my personal portfolio. I built this thing from scratch because apparently that's what cool kids do these days (and I'm a cool kid).

## My Color Choices

**Main Palette:**
- Purple (#8b5cf6) - Because purple is objectively the best color
- Black (#1a1a1a) - For that edgy aesthetic  
- Gold (#f59e0b) - Because I'm fancy

**Trans Theme:**
- Pink (#fce4ec), Blue (#e1f5fe), White (#f3e5f5)
- Soft, beautiful colors that make me happy

## How to Get the Trans Theme

**Triple tap my name** "Ivy Mycelia" in the hero section. You have 1 second to do it, so be quick! It's like a secret handshake, but with your mouse.

## What This Portfolio Does

- Shows off my projects (because that's what portfolios are for)
- Has smooth animations everywhere because it tickles my brain
- Theme switching because I can't decide what I like
- Hidden features because it's fun to poke random hidden buttons

## My Tech Stack

- HTML - Because I'm not a monster
- CSS - With variables because I'm fancy
- JavaScript - Vanilla, because I don't trust frameworks

## My Projects

- **Blight & Bloom** - A game engine I made from scratch
- **Myco** - A programming language I wrote in C
- **Air Quality Monitor** - Environmental monitoring system

## Want to Collaborate?

I'm always down for engine work, experimental stuff, and projects that shouldn't exist. Let's break some rules.

## Customization

Change the CSS variables in `:root` if you want to be boring:
```css
--accent-purple: #8b5cf6;
--accent-gold: #f59e0b;
--accent-black: #1a1a1a;
```

## Why I Built It This Way

- No frameworks - Because I'm stubborn
- Vanilla everything - Because I like to suffer
- Custom animations - Because I'm extra
- Hidden features - Because I'm mysterious

## License

I don't really care what you do with this. It's just a portfolio website. Copy it, improve it, just don't claim you built it from scratch.
